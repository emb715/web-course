`A network is like a chain of computer that can comunicate with each other.`

A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources.
The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

Two very common types of networks include:
- Local Area Network **(LAN)**
    
    Is a network that is confined to a relatively small area. It is generally limited to a geographic area such as a house, school, building or office.

- Wide Area Network **(WAN)**
    
    Connect networks in larger geographic areas, such as Provice/State, a Country, or the world. Dedicated transoceanic cabling or satellite uplinks may be used to connect this type of global network.
